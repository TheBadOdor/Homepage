            <p class="para">The White Swiss Shepherd is a fairly newly recognised breed that is also referred to as Berger Blanc Suisse. They look like a white version of the Shepherd family, with pointy ears and the typical Shepherd face but with a slightly smaller body structure. However, they have quite a different temperament. <p>
            <p class="para">White Swiss Shepherds are easy to train and are extremely clingy to their owners. They will follow you around everywhere, even to places you don’t really want them to, like your bed. You may feel like you have a big white shadow attached to you…one that can reach up to 50kg on the scales!</p>
            <p class="para">Once a White Swiss Shepherd falls in love with you, there is no escape from their devotion to you. They have a tendency to be warm and welcoming to children but can be skeptical with strangers at first. </p>
            <p class="para">Like the rest of the Shepherd family, they are bright and intelligent and love to work things out for themselves. This means that simple long walks will not be enough stimulation for this breed. They will perform excellently in dog sports of any kind.  </p>
            <p class="para">White Swiss Shepherds are quite sensitive and like to be raised fair, with praise and treats. They want to please and will follow and listen well to make their owners happy. They are intuitive to their owners’ feelings and emotions and make a great companion dog, if you can handle their size. </p>
            <p class="para">This breed’s coat is easy to handle, and brushing once or twice a week is sufficient. But be warned to expect lots of shedding twice a year, and you will not be able to wear black clothes without looking silly.</p>
